# BOW Method and VGG Network for Image Classification

## Overview
This project describes 2 image classification systems that use respectively the Bag of Words (BOW) method and a VGG convolutional neural network. They are designed to classify images by effectively capturing and analyzing their features.

## Key Features
- Utilizes the BOW method for feature extraction from images.
- Employs a VGG network, a type of convolutional neural network, for image classification.
- Suitable for various applications in image recognition and computer vision.

## Technical Details
- The project combines the BOW method for feature representation with the deep learning capabilities of the VGG network.
- It includes Python scripts and utilizes libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for neural network implementation.

## Usage
Instructions for setting up and using the application, including requirements and execution steps, are provided in the project's documentation.
